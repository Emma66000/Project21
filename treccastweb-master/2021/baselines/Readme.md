## Baseline run description

The baseline system is a three-step retrieval process where, given a query, (1) the top-n documents are retrieved from the index and (2) chunked into passages using Spacy's SentenceRecognizer pipeline. (3) Passages are then re-ranked using a neural re-ranker.

For (1), we use a simple BM25 function (K1=4.46, b=0.82), and for (3), we use a [T5 re-ranker](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.63/) trained on the MS MARCO passage dataset.

`org_automatic_results_1000.v1.0.run` is the results file generated by retrieving and re-ranking the passages from the top 1000 documents using the automatic rewrites. 

`org_manual_results_1000.v1.0.run` is the results file generated by retrieving and re-ranking the passages from the top 1000 documents using the manual rewrites.

Note: We also provide the source BM25 document runs used in the passage ranking. These are not submittable runs, but the candidate documents used when identifying source passages.

`org_automatic_results_docs_1000.v1.0.run` is the candidate file generated by retrieving the top 1000 documents with BM25 using the automatic rewrites.

`org_manual_results_docs_1000.v1.0.run` is the candidate file generated by retrieving the top 1000 documents with BM25 using the manual rewrites.

## Baseline Rewriter Policy

We use the [T5 model trained on the CANARD dataset](https://huggingface.co/castorini/t5-base-canard) to generate our baseline automatic rewrites.

For a given query `n` in a topic, the rewrite context consists of all queries from previous turns (turn `1` to turn `n-1`) and the passages from the last three turns (turn `n-3` to turn `n-1`).

For example, the automatic rewrite for topic `107`, turn `8` (identified as `107-8`) was generated by passing the following as context:

`query 107-1 ||| query 107-2 ||| query 107-3 ||| query 107-4 ||| query 107-5 ||| passage 107-5 ||| query 107-6 ||| passage 107-6 ||| query 107-7 ||| passage 107-7`
