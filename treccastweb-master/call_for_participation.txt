 --- GOALS  ---
The goal is to advance Conversational Information Seeking research and create large-scale reusable test collections for open-domain conversational search systems. 

This is the first year of TREC CAsT, which is running as a track in the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). The main task is that, given a sequence of utterances that a user might ask to a conversational agent like the Google Assistant, Cortana, Siri, or Alexa, to retrieve relevant content that satisfies the user's information need. This requires: 
 * Tracking the evolution of the information need in the conversation and identifying salient information for each turn
 * Retrieving candidate response passages from a large heterogeneous collection of paragraphs

--- Task Description ---
See the website (http://treccast.ai) for full details, including the Year 1 Task Guidelines and trainings topics. 

For year 1, participants of the track will be challenged with retrieving relevant paragraphs for each turn in a conversational topic. 
* Topics: Manually developed information seeking topics  
* Data collection: (1) Wikipedia paragraphs, (2) Microsoft MARCO web passages, (3) Washington Post news 

Note: Where possible we link our topics to the recently released MS MARCO Conversational Search corpus, a large collection of artificial information seeking sessions linked to the MS MARCO dataset.
